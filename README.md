# The Beauty Garage

The Beauty Garage is a React Native app for a fictional beauty salon that allows users to book appointments and view services offered by the salon.

# Installation
To run the app, you will need to have Node.js and either the Expo CLI or Android Studio installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
-  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
- Run npm start to start the development server.
- Once the development server is running, you can open the app on your Android or iOS device by scanning the QR code with the Expo app, or you can launch an Android emulator from within Android Studio to run the app on your computer.

# Usage
When you launch the app, you will be taken to the home screen where you can view the services offered by the salon. To book an appointment, navigate to the Appointments tab and select a date and time slot that is available. You will be prompted to enter your name and contact information, and then you can confirm the appointment.
