        <Text>{"The number on the front of the pot represents the mg per kg of MGO (Methylglyoxal) and the related strength of Antimicrobial Activity, which is known to kill certain types of bacteria. The greater the number, the stronger the Antimicrobial Activity. MGO in Mﾄ］uka honey is naturally made in the hive from DHA which is present in the nectar of the Manuka Bush. Within the hive, DHA undergoes the Maillard reaction to naturally form MGO. 100% Genuine New Zealand Mﾄ］uka Honey. Independently tested to show it meets the New Zealand Government's definition of Mﾄ］uka honey. Honey should not be given to infants under 12 months old.
